## Summary

This is Project 2 for the **Front End Developer Nanodegree Program** at **Udacity**. The project consist of a landing page with a dynamic behavior. There should be at least 4 sections and the Navigation Menu should be dynamically generated using **JavaScript**.

## The JavaScript Code

All the **JavaScript** code was done in the `js/app.js`.

The following functionality was added using JavaScript:
* Built the Navigation Menu dynamically depending on the number of sections.

* Added functionality to view the active section for both, the section in the viewport and the same item in the Navigation Menu.

* Added Event Listeners to scroll into section when clicking on the corresponding Navigation Menu item.

* Added a functionality to hide the Navigation Menu while not scrolling. This functionality is only active while the Y Offset is greater than 120px.

* Added a button that appears while the Y Offset is greater than 120px. This button allows for a smooth scroll back to top _(Y Offset = 0px)_.

* Added a button to each section title that allows to collapse or extend _(while collapsed)_ the section.

## The HTML and CSS Code

The **HTML** and **CSS** were modified to complete all requirements.

In **HTML** content was added regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. One section was added having a total of four from the original project, and some classes were added to the existent code. Some elements were added from external sources _(a video and two graphics)_.

In **CSS** new classes were added and some were modified. Also an external font from **Google Fonts** was added too. Media query was used for responsiveness.
